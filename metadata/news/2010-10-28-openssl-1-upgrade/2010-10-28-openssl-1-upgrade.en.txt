News-Item-Format: 1.0
Display-If-Installed: dev-libs/openssl[<1.0.0b]

dev-libs/openssl[>=1.0.0] has been unmasked. Although this upgrade
breaks ABI we've opted not to slot openssl at this time. This means that
to avoid mass breakage you must follow this upgrade procedure.

Before upgrading, do a global sync, then make sure you have the distfile
for wget stored in your local cache:

    cave sync
    cave resolve -fx0 '*/*' wget

Now upgrade openssl (version 1.0.0a should be unmasked) and merge its
configuration changes:

    cave resolve -1zx openssl
    eclectic config interactive
    c_rehash /etc/ssl/certs

This breaks some parts of Paludis and a few of its dependencies and
sub-dependencies. To navigate safely out of this mess, rebuild/upgrade
the following packages in order:

1. wget
2. libssh2, curl (you can skip these here if you don't have git[curl]
   enabled)
3. git
4. neon, subversion (you can skip these here if you don't use
   libarchive-scm)
5. libarchive
6. paludis (make sure to build the latest -scm revision)

At this point Paludis and its dependencies should be working again. If
something failed to build, it probably depends on something not listed
here that depends on openssl, so identify and rebuild the offending
package(s).

Finally, let cave fix everything else for you:

    cave fix-linkage -x
