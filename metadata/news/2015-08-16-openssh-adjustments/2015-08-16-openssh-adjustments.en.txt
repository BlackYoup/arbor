Several changes of note have occurred with the recent release of Openssh 7.0[1].
Of particular importance are the following changes:

 * Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange
   is disabled by default at run-time. It may be re-enabled manually[2].

 * Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-* host and user keys is disabled
   by default at run-time. These may be re-enabled manually[2].

 * The default for the sshd_config(5) PermitRootLogin option has
   changed from "yes" to "prohibit-password".

 * PermitRootLogin=without-password/prohibit-password now bans all
   interactive authentication methods, allowing only public-key,
   hostbased and GSSAPI authentication (previously it permitted
   keyboard-interactive and password-less authentication if those
   were enabled).
