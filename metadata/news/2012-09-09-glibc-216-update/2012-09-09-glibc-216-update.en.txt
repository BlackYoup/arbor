We've just unmasked glibc 2.16 after testing the entire system set on
amd64 and x86 against it.

Some patches were applied due to changes in gnulib which some projects
haven't yet adapted to. These are the predominant issues with glibc
2.16:
- sys/resource.h must now be included directly
- glibc dropped gets and gnulib intentionally doesn't have a gets
  module

It's possible that more packages are affected by these changes so if
you hit build failures like

./stdio.h:1012:1: error: 'gets' undeclared here (not in a function)

you've found something to work on. Please make a patch, test it, submit
it upstream and on zebrapig and we'll take care of it.

Should you face any other problems, please let us know on IRC or on the
mailinglist (exherbo-dev@lists.exherbo.org).

Always remember: Do NOT downgrade glibc!
This is your last chance to mask glibc 2.16.
