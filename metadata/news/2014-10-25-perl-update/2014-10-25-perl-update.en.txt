perl has been bumped to 5.20.1

To switch to that version run:

eclectic perl set 5.20

As always after changing perl slots, you need to rebuild all packages that
install perl modules. To do this you can run:

cave resolve -1x $(cave print-owners -f '%c/%p:%s ' /usr/LIBDIR/perl5/vendor_perl/5.18-arch )
cave resolve -1x $(cave print-owners -f '%c/%p:%s ' /usr/LIBDIR/perl5/vendor_perl/5.18-pure )

where LIBDIR is 'lib' if you are on a 32bit arch and 'lib64' if you are on 64bit.

If you installed any site-modules manually, you have to reinstall those as well.

If you still have perl versions <5.18, you have to rebuild everything in the
/usr/LIBDIR/perl5/vendor_perl directory. Please remove these Versions, as they
are no longer supported.
