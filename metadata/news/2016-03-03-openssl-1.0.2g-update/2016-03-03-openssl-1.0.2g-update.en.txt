OpenSSL has released version 1.0.2g which gets rid of SSLv2 for security reasons.
They removed all symbols for SSL2 with no soname bump, resulting in breakages not
getting caught by fix-linkage.

Before you do the update, be sure you have the latest wget tarball around in case
it gets broken, and as soon as you've updated openssl, reinstall all the dependents
of openssl to be sure nothing's broken.

    cave resolve nothing -D openssl
