With sys-libs/pam[>=1.1.8-r2] the default password encryption algorithm was
changed from md5 to sha512. As long as you don't set a new password nothing
will happen. Only newly set or changed passwords will be encrypted with
sha512.

You can check which users still have an md5 password hash with
fgrep '$1$' /etc/shadow

If you don't want this change you can manually edit /etc/pam.d/system-auth to
your liking.
