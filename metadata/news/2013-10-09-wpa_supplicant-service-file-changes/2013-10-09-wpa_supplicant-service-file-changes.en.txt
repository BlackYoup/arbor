From now on we don't use our own service file for wpa_supplicant.
The respective config file can be removed (
/etc/conf.d/wpa_supplicant.conf).
NetworkManager users can probably safely ignore that change.
For the others:
You specify that stuff in a per device config, e.g. for wlp2s0:
/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-nl80211-wlp2s0.conf
You can find an example for the config:
/usr/share/doc/wpa_supplicant-2.0/wpa_supplicant.conf
and enable it with:
systemctl start wpa_supplicant-nl80211@wlp2s0.service

There are:
wpa_supplicant@.service, wpa_supplicant-nl80211@.service and
wpa_supplicant-wired@.service
Also:
wpa_supplicant.service which is for the DBUS interface only.

For more information consult the documentation of wpa_supplicant and
systemd.
