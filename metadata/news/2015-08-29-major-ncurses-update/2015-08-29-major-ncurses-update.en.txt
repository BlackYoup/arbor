sys-libs/ncurses has been upgraded to 6.0, a new major version of the library.

Due to this, there's some work that should be done before you go forward and
upgrade it to the newest version; ncurses is a part of many of the system's
libraries and components, such as bash, and failure to heed this warning and
follow the steps detailed here will break your system, and you will be upset.

1. Install ncurses[compat-libs]

    # cave resolve -1 ncurses[compat-libs]

2. Reinstall all dependencies of ncurses

    # cave resolve -D ncurses nothing

3. Reinstall gcc, which seems to be indirect dependencies of ncurses

    # cave resolve -1 gcc

4. Reinstall ncurses without [compat-libs]

    # cave resolve -1 ncurses

5. Fix any broken links

    # cave fix-linkage

Any issues with this should be reported to IRC, but please make sure you follow
these steps correctly first.
