GCC 5 was released a while ago, and has been tested thoroughly by our
developers and more adventurous users. GCC 5 has brought many new features,
including better diagnostics and output coloration, to name a few visible
differences. With GCC 5's release, this has also brought new versions of
packages provided by it, such as libstdc++, libatomic, libgomp, and others.

As such, I have now removed its testing mask.

1.  Install sys-devel/gcc:5.1

    # cave resolve -1 sys-devel/gcc:5.1

2.  Switch to the newly installed GCC version

    # eclectic gcc set 5.1
    # eclectic cc set gcc
    # eclectic c++ set gcc
    # eclectic cpp set gcc

3.  Install sys-libs/libstdc++:5.1

    # cave resolve -1 sys-libs/libstdc++:5.1

Any issues with GCC 5's installation should be reported to IRC. If you hit
issues compiling packages with it, please send patches in to fix the
package in question. Many distributions have switched to GCC 5 already, so
you will likely find a patch for any package that fails to compile with it.
