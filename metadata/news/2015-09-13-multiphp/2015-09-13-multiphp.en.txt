Here comes multiphp.
You will now be able to install multiple versions of php in parallel
slots and install your dev-pecl/* stuff for several versions.

The only manual action required is that if you currently are using
php 5.6 for example, you have to do:

mv /etc/php /etc/php-5.6
mv /etc/pear.conf /etc/pear-5.6.conf

The used suboption is "php_abis", currently supporting slots
5.4, 5.5 and 5.6

php-pecl.exlib gain one exparam:
- php_abis: the list of supported slots (defaults to all)
