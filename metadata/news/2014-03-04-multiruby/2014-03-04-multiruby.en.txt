Here comes multiruby. Your gems will be installed for all your
installed (and selected) ruby slots.

The used suboption is "ruby_abis", currently supporting slots
2.0 and 2.1.

Gems will need to be updated to specify their dependencies with
"[ruby_abis:*(-)?]".
This change is break gem.exlib API but all gems used the minimal
API, so nothing to change on this side.

gem.exlib gain two exparams:
- ruby_slots: the list of supported slots (defaults to all)
- ruby_opt: the option enabling the ruby support (if the gem
            should only be installed conditionnaly)
If you specify ruby_opt, you have to call gem_src_install by
yourself.
