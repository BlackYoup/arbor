A new set called 'stages' has been added to arbor. Packages in this set get
added to the 'world' set and installed by default in new stages.

Unlike packages in the 'system' set, packages in the 'stages' set can be
uninstalled if you really don't want them.

Until now sys-apps/busybox has been part of the 'system' set because we deem
it very useful in case of a broken system. It has now been moved to the
'stages' set.

Unless you are absolutely certain you don't want to keep it installed we
recommend that you add it to the 'world' set manually.

The change was discussed in this thread:
