GCC dependencies have been updated to depend on elfutils instead of libelf for
GCC 4.5, and to have no dependency on either with GCC 4.6+.  elfutils and libelf
are mutually incompatible (and thus have blockers on each other), which
complicates the migration process.

If Link Time Optimization (LTO) is enabled in your installation (-flto present
in CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS), it should temporarily be disabled to permit the
migration.  You may re-enable LTO once GCC has been rebuilt after the removal of
libelf.

Once LTO is disabled, it is safe to remove libelf (cave uninstall -x libelf),
and then rebuild GCC (which will build elfutils if necessary).  Because other
applications may be dependent on libelf, it is recommended that you rebuild
those packages once GCC has been rebuilt (cave fix-linkage -x).

Should you face any other problems, please let us know on IRC or on the mailing
list (exherbo-dev@lists.exherbo.org).
