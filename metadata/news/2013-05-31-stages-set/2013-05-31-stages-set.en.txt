Stages come pre-installed with the contents of two sets. The system set is part
of world and cannot be uninstalled. The stages set is a set of packages that are
deemed useful for an initial install but are not required. Performing a
'cave resolve world' will not upgrade those installed packages. Therefore you
should inspect the packages listed by:

    cave show stages

You have three options on how to handle these.

1. If you want all of them and any packages that may be added to this set in the
   future, add the stages set to world:

    cave resolve stages

2. Add the individual packages you want to keep to world:

    cave update-world $package

3. Uninstall the packages you do not want to keep:

    cave purge
