The default libjpeg provider has switched from ijg-jpeg (the "Independent JPEG Group"
implementation) to libjpeg-turbo.

This change has been made to match the same default as many other Linux distributions
use. Many recent Linux packages are tested only with libjpeg-turbo now, so you
are more likely to see errors - build failures, test failures, possibly runtime
errors - if you keep using ijg-jpeg.

As long as you don't have any packages installed which depend directly on
media-libs/jpeg, a simple cave resolve command should complete the switch:

cave resolve -c world --permit-uninstall media-libs/jpeg

If you wish to keep using ijg-jpeg despite the warning above, add a line like the
following to your options.conf:

*/* PROVIDERS: -jpeg-turbo ijg-jpeg
