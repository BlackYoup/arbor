WARNING: libgcrypt after 1.5.3 breaks Whirlpool hash encrypted
containers.

In gcrypt 1.5.3 and before Whirlpool is broken and it was fixed in
the next version. If you selected Whirlpool as hash on creation of
a LUKS container, it does not work anymore with the fixed library.

cryptsetup 1.6.4 in combination with libgcrypt 1.6.1 or later
introduced a compatibility feature for handling broken containers.

Please refer to the upstream FAQ about how to handle the situation,
details can be found in "8.3 Gcrypt after 1.5.3 breaks Whirlpool":
