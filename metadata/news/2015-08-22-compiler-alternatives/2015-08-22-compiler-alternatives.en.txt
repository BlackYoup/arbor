Alternatives for the C, C++, and Fortran compilers have been created, and
we now have support for using different compilers as system compilers.
This means that you can compile packages (and your own code) with compilers
other than GCC, such as Clang, without having to set environment variables
manually. Right now Clang is the only offered alternative, as it's the best
alternative to GCC that is around right now.

As you may know, Clang still has issues compiling some packages, and as such
we still recommend that you use GCC if you are not comfortable dealing with
and fixing compiler errors relating to Clang's differences in functionality
from GCC.

If you don't have Clang installed, this won't affect you, as GCC is the
default system-wide C compiler and will stay there for the forseeable future.

You can see the newly created alternatives with `eclectic cc list`,
`eclectic c++ list`, and `eclectic fc list`.

Right now there is no alternative to gfortran, so if you feel the desire to
use a different Fortran compiler, send patches in for the alternative desired.
