The options simple-net and static-net have been removed from
systemd[>=213].

Both simple-net and static-net provided a way to configure your network
interface(s) statically. If you need this functionality, you should now
switch to systemd-networkd which provides this and DHCP functionality
as well.

You can find more details about this at

http://coreos.com/blog/intro-to-systemd-networkd/

and

http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-networkd.service.html

Here's a simple example from my own configuration
/etc/systemd/network/enp3s0.network:

----
[Match]
Name=enp3s0

[Network]
DNS=192.168.168.1

[Address]
Address=192.168.168.113/24

[Route]
Gateway=192.168.168.1
----

Furthermore, systemd-timesyncd (NTP client) and systemd-resolvd
(resolv.conf handling) are installed but are *not* configured to
replace whatever you might currently be using.
If you want to use them (both work very well), read their man pages.
