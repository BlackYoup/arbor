icu has been bumped to 55.1. As it frequently breaks ABI, it has been slotted
to prevent breaking your desktops and browsers, which means you need to
rebuild all packages depending on dev-libs/icu. To do this you can run:

# cave fix-linkage --library libicui18n.so.54 --library libicuio.so.54 \
 --library libicule.so.54 --library libiculx.so.54 --library libicuuc.so.54

(Alternatively you can use:

# cave resolve -D icu:54.1 nothing

Which might not match all the things you want though, depending on your installed
icu dependencies.)
