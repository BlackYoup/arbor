In systemd[>=41], the systemd executable moves from /bin/systemd to
/lib/systemd/systemd. Thus, an existing /sbin/init symlink needs to
be adapted with the update.
The exheres will do it but you should check carefully it succeeded
anyway.

Furthermore, systemd[>=41] requires kmod[>=5] now. While this is not an
issue in itself, kmod[>=5] breaks udev[<181] (potentially making
systems unbootable!).

In consequence, you need to update all three at once or at least
refrain from rebooting until you did.

Last but not least, systemd[=42] will most likely be the last version
to install boot-critical components to / and others to /usr. This split
is already causing issues with respect to tmpfiles, intrinsic
dependencies and dependencies on stuff on /usr.

This won't matter to you if you don't have /usr split from / (it should
*not* be split;
cf. http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/separate-usr-is-broken
).
If you do have /usr separated from /, you'll *have* to use an initramfs
(preferrably created by dracut) for booting.
The rest is for another news item.
