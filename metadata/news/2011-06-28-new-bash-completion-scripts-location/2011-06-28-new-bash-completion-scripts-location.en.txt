Starting with version bash-completion-1.3_p20110628 the only supported
location for the completion scripts is
/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/.  Scripts in the directory
/etc/bash_completion.d/ are ignored as well as /etc/bash_completion
and /etc/bash/bashrc.d/bash-completion.sh scripts.  It is safe to
remove these directories and files.  Since all installed completions
are now enabled by default, the eclectic bashcomp module is no longer
of use and has been removed.  Packages using bash-completion.exlib
will make use of this change automatically but need to be reinstalled.
The following command provides a list of relevant packages:

# cave print-ids --matching '*/*::/[bash-completion][.INHERITED<bash-completion]' -f '%c/%p:%s\n'

Packages that make use of the deprecated locations and don't inherit
bash-completion.exlib will need to be fixed.
