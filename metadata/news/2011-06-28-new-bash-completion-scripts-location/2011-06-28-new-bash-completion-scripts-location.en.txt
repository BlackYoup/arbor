Starting with bash-completion-1.3_p20110628 the only supported location for bash
completion scripts is /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/.

The /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh and /etc/bash_completion scripts
have been replaced by /etc/bash/bashrc.d/bash-completion.sh in order
to enable completions in all interactive sessions. You can remove
those.

Since all installed completions are now enabled by default, the eclectic
bashcomp module is no longer of use and has been removed in eclectic 2.0.7.

Packages using bash-completion.exlib will make use of this change automatically,
but need to be reinstalled. The following command provides a list of relevant
packages:

# cave print-ids --matching '*/*::/[bash-completion][.INHERITED<bash-completion]' -f '%c/%p:%s\n'

Packages that make use of the deprecated locations, /usr/share/bash-completion/
and /etc/bash_completion.d/, and don't inherit bash-completion.exlib will need
to be fixed manually.

# cave owner /etc/bash_completion.d/

If that command shows nothing, it is safe to remove /etc/bash_completion.d/.

The symlinks in that directory were created by the now removed eclectic bashcomp
module.
