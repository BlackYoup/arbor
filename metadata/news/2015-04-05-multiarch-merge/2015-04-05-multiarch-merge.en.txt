Exherbo's multi-arch/cross implementation[1] has been merged to master.

You WILL have to migrate to this new setup in order to be able to install
new software and updates.

You'll find the migration guide at [2]. Make sure to follow it VERY closely
because getting things wrong does have the potential to break your system.
(You'll of course be able to access your data via a rescue system if everything
goes wrong. We're changing the base system but are NOT touching user data.)

If you don't want to migrate right now, you shouldn't update or install ANYTHING
anymore until you are ready to do so.

The last commit prior to the migration has been tagged as "pre-cross" in all
official repositories so that you can stick with that if need be.
If you wish to stay on the pre-cross revision, you need to set
"sync_options = --revision=pre-cross" in the repository's configuration file.

If you do migrate (which you should), you'll find that some packages might not
yet install. As always, you're fully expected to help with migrating exheres
to the new base system which basically involves undoing our former multi-lib
approach. You'll find more details at [3] and you're, of course, encouraged to
look at recent commits that mention "multiarch" or "cross" for tips on
converting other packages.

Furthermore, we have no control over 3rd-party/unofficial repositories. While
quite a few of them feature a "cross" branch right now, they might not have been
merged when the official repositories were.
Thus, you might have to add "sync_options = --branch=cross" (without the
quotation marks) to the respective repository's configuration until the
maintainer has merged the cross branch into master.
