Perl has been bumped to 5.22.1

To switch to that version, run...

    # eclectic perl set 5.22

As always after changing perl slots, you will need to rebuild all packages
that install Perl modules. To do this, you can run...

    # cave resolve -1x $(cave print-owners -f '%c/%p:%s ' /usr/${CHOST}/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.20-arch )
    # cave resolve -1x $(cave print-owners -f '%c/%p:%s ' /usr/${CHOST}/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.20-pure )

Replacing ${CHOST} with the triplet matching your system, and executing
those commands for any cross targets which Perl is installed to.

In addition, if you installed any site-modules manually, you have to
reinstall those as well.
