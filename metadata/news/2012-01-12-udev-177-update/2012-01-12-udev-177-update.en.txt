For the udev-177 update, you need to enable the DEVTMPFS kernel option
(-> Device Drivers -> Generic Driver Options) to get the devtmpfs
filesystem. This is an upstream change. From udev's NEWS file:

"The 'devtmpfs' filesystem is required now, udev will not create or
delete device nodes anymore, it only adjusts permissions and ownership
of device nodes and maintains additional symlinks."

If you don't have DEVTMPFS enabled in your kernel when booting with
udev-177, things will *NOT* work.

Furthermore, if you're using systemd, you should update to systemd >= 38.
Earlier systemd versions will work but issue a non-fatal error during
booting.
