In order to facilitate python multibuild, we have introduced
setup-py.exlib and changed the API for python.exlib.

For executables the highest supported python version will be used by
default from now on. To override one can manually run the executable
with the desired python interpreter (e.g. python2.7 /usr/bin/script.py).

The new API is incompatible with the previous multibuild python
packaging, and packages which are currently relying on python.exlib
APIv2 will need to be converted over to the new system.  Currently, we
have 70 packages that have yet to be converted, and any help fixing
those packages is appreciated. Refer to [1] for more details on how to
fix them properly.
