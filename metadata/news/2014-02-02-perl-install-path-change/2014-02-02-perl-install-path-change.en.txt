perl has been bumped to 5.18.2
As of this version, the path to which perl modules are installed has changed.
You need to rebuild all packages that install perl modules after you updated perl.
To do this you can run:
	cave resolve -1x $(cave print-owners -f '%c/%p:%s ' /usr/LIBDIR/perl5/vendor_perl)

where LIBDIR is 'lib' if you are on a 32bit arch and 'lib64' if you are on 64bit.

If you installed any site-modules manually, you have to reinstall those as well.

The upside to this is that in the future, perl modules will ony need to be rebuilt on major version bumps.
