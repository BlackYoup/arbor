With systemd-udev from systemd[~197], the naming scheme for network
interfaces changes
Up to and including systemd[~196], the network interface names were
applied by the Linux kernel in the order of probing them which is not
completely predictable. In case of multiple network interfaces, the
naming was not necessarily static anymore and, thus, in practice, e. g.
eth0 could become eth1 on the next boot (I've actually had that happen
with wlan0/1).
This can be troublesome for static network setups, firewalls, etc.

From systemd[~197] onwards, systemd-udev will automatically assign
predictable, stable network interface names for all local Ethernet,
WLAN and WWAN interfaces. This is a departure from the traditional
interface naming scheme ("eth0", "eth1", "wlan0", ...).

You can find more details about this on
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames

On Exherbo, I've implemented an opt-out model: If you really insist on
having non-static network interface names, set the "old-net" option for
systemd[>=197]. This is option 1 from the above URL.
Of course, you can implement your own naming scheme if you want to,
check the above-mentioned URL for more details.
