app-text/tidy has changed its versioning scheme, due to the upstream now having
new maintainers, with new releases as opposed to the CVS snapshots that have
been used for years.

Because of this, upon upgrading, you will be prompted to downgrade app-text/tidy
to 5.1.25, because it appears to be a lesser version than the date scheme being
used previously.

To deal with this:

    cave resolve -1 app-text/tidy --permit-downgrade app-text/tidy

In addition, if you have app-text/tidy-html5::alip installed, you'll be asked to
remove it before upgrading app-text/tidy.
