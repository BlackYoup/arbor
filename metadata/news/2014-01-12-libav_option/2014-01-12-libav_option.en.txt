Most packages using ffmpeg were updated to work with libav too.
This lead the || ( media/ffmpeg media/libav ) dependencies in Exherbo.

These dependencies are now using the libav option.
This option is just a dependency switch.
You need to enable it for every package you build with ffmpeg support
(being mandatory or with an option).
