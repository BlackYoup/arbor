isl and cloog have been updated and slotted with alternatives light to allow
safer updates in the future.

If you have the 'graphite' option enabled for sys-devel/gcc, you need to be
careful when updating in order to avoid breaking gcc.
You have to install the corresponding versions of the newly slotted isl and
cloog first regardless of a possibly newer version.

For example if you have isl:0[=0.09] and cloog:0[=0.17.0] installed, make sure
to install isl:0.9[=0.09-r1] and cloog:0.17[=0.17.0-r1] first:

# cave resolve -1 -D isl:0 -D cloog:0 isl:0.9 cloog:0.17 gcc

Afterwards you can freely update isl and cloog.

Another possibility is to temporarily disable the 'graphite' option of at
least one gcc slot and use that slot to update, fix linkage and re-enable
'graphite'.
