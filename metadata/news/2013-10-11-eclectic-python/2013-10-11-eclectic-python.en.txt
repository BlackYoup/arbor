WARNING: experimental, it is recommended that you stick with
python2 as the default. You can check with "eclectic python show"
once you've updated your system.

You are now able to switch your system python version using
eclectic python set <2|3>
All you have to do is to update your installed python2 slots,
as some files provided by eclectic-python were formerly provided
by eclectic python2, and then the python3 ones if any.

If you update some python3 slots before the python2 ones, python3
will be selected as the system python, run "eclectic python set 2"
to switch back to python2.

Whilst having python3 as the system python is currently not officially
supported by a lot of exhereses and upstreams, this is a first step forward.

Patches welcome if things break with python3. And things *WILL* break.

Note that at least all packages using python.exlib without api=2 are
currently broken with python3 as the default.
