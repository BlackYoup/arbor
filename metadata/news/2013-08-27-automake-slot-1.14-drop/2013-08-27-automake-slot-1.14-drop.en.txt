Because it is not required to have a new slot for automake-1.14 we dropped it again.
To get rid of it do:

cave resolve --reinstall-dependents-of sys-devel/automake:1.14 nothing

cave resolve automake -U sys-devel/automake:1.14

If the second command still show you some conflicts please fix them by depending on automake:1.13 instead of :1.14 in the package.
