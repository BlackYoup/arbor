From now on we have a suboption called PYTHON_ABIS which will
specify which python version will be used while building your
package.
To date that was controlled via eclectic python2 so for now you
should set it to the same version as the selected version of
eclectic. The default is currently 2.7 for the suboption.

As soon as every package is updated to the new python.exlib API
this is independent of eclectic python2 and you are free to
change the option as you want (you will be informed).

For now it is only allowed to select at most one.
