eclectic-gcc was pushed to the tree a while back to solve some issues with
multiple GCC slots not working well with regards to the compiler alternatives
changes. This has caused some issues with people running into missing `cpp`
links, because eclectic-gcc now provides the alternatives for `cc` that gcc
itself once provided.

Here's what you should do if you haven't upgraded yet:

1.  Upgrade GCC and eclectic-gcc to the latest version

    # cave resolve -1 gcc eclectic-gcc

2.  Ensure that `cc`, `c++`, `cpp`, and `fc` run fine

    # x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-cc --version
    # x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-c++ --version
    # x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-cpp --version
    # x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-fc --version

3.  If for any of those commands, bash tells you the command is not found,
    relink them to eclectic-gcc's providers.

    # eclectic cc set gcc
    # eclectic c++ set gcc
    # eclectic cpp set gcc
    # eclectic fc set gcc

If you have already upgraded, and you currently have broken links for any
of those commands, only do step three.

If you have any further issues, feel free to get out the pitchforks and
knives and come to #exherbo, I'll be there for stabbing and other complaints.
