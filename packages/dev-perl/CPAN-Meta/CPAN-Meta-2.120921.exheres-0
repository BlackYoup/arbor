SUMMARY="the distribution metadata for a CPAN dist"
DESCRIPTION="
Software distributions released to the CPAN include a META.json or, for older distributions,
META.yml, which describes the distribution, its contents, and the requirements for building and
installing the distribution. The data structure stored in the META.json file is described in
CPAN::Meta::Spec. CPAN::Meta provides a simple class to represent this distribution metadata (or
*distmeta*), along with some helpful methods for interrogating that data. The documentation below
is only for the methods of the CPAN::Meta object. For information on the meaning of individual
fields, consult the spec.
