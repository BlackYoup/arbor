SUMMARY="Map Perl operating system names to generic types"
DESCRIPTION="
Modules that provide OS-specific behaviors often need to know if the current
operating system matches a more generic type of operating systems. For example,
'linux' is a type of 'Unix' operating system and so is 'freebsd'. This module
provides a mapping between an operating system name as given by $^O and a more
generic type. The initial version is based on the OS type mappings provided in
Module::Build and ExtUtils::CBuilder. (Thus, Microsoft operating systems are
given the type 'Windows' rather than 'Win32'.)
