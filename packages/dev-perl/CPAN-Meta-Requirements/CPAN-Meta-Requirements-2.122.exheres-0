SUMMARY="a set of version requirements for a CPAN dist"
DESCRIPTION="
A CPAN::Meta::Requirements object models a set of version constraints like those specified in the 
META.yml or META.json files in CPAN distributions. It can be built up by adding more and more 
constraints, and it will reduce them to the simplest representation. Logically impossible 
constraints will be identified immediately by thrown exceptions.
