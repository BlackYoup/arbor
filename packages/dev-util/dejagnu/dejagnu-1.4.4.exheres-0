DESCRIPTION="DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs. Its
purpose is to provide a single front end for all tests. Think of it as
a custom library of Tcl procedures crafted to support writing a test
harness. A test harness is the testing infrastructure that is created
to support a specific program or tool. Each program can have multiple
testsuites, all supported by a single test harness. DejaGnu is written
in Expect, which in turn uses Tcl -- Tool command language."
