SUMMARY="A small collection of programs that operate on patch files"
DESCRIPTION="
Patchutils contains a collection of tools for manipulating patch files: interdiff,
combinediff, flipdiff, filterdiff, fixcvsdiff, rediff, lsdiff, grepdiff, splitdiff,
recountdiff, and unwrapdiff. You can use interdiff to create an incremental patch
between two patches that are against a common source tree, combinediff for creating
a cumulative diff from two incremental patches, and flipdiff to transpose two
incremental patches. Filterdiff is for extracting or excluding patches from a
patch set based on modified files matching shell wildcards. Lsdiff lists modified
files in a patch. Rediff, recountdiff, and unwrapdiff correct hand-edited (or
otherwise broken) patches.
