SUMMARY="A build tool, backward compatible with Perforce Jam, a make replacement"
DESCRIPTION="
Boost.Jam (BJam) is a build tool based on FTJam, which in turn is based on
Perforce Jam. It contains significant improvements made to facilitate its use
in the Boost Build System, but should be backward compatible with Perforce Jam.

Jam is a make(1) replacement that makes building simple things simple and
building complicated things manageable.  Jam's language is expressive, making
Jamfiles (c.f. Makefiles) compact.  Jam handles header file dependencies
automatically and on-the-fly.  Jam is very portable: it runs on UNIX, VMS, Mac,
and NT. Most Jamfiles themselves are portable.  Jam is unintrusive: it is
small, it has negligible CPU overhead, and it doesn't create any of its own
funny files (c.f. Odin, nmake, SunOS make).  Jam can build large projects
spread across many directories in one pass, without recursing, tracking the
relationships among all files. Jam can do this with multiple, concurrent
processes.  Jam isn't under the blinkin GNU copyright, so you can incorporate
it into commercial products.
