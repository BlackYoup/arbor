Subject: [PATCH 2/2] fixincludes: Set CPPFLAGS

This way the flags specified by configure will be honored.

Signed-off-by: Michael Forney <mforney@mforney.org>

When fixincludes is configured for the build architecture, CPPFLAGS is set from
build_configargs. However, there is no place for it to get substituted in
Makefile.in, causing the CPPFLAGS set at build-time to be used.
