SUMMARY="Tool for automating interactive applications"

DESCRIPTION="Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications
such as telnet, ftp, passwd, fsck, rlogin, tip, etc. Expect really
makes this stuff trivial. Expect is also useful for testing these same
applications. And by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive
applications in X11 GUIs.

Expect can make easy all sorts of tasks that are prohibitively
difficult with anything else. You will find that Expect is an
absolutely invaluable tool - using it, you will be able to automate
tasks that you've never even thought of before - and you'll be able to
do this automation quickly and easily."
