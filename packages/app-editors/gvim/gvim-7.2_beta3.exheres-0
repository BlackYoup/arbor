SUMMARY="Graphical interface for Vim, an improved vi-style text editor"
DESCRIPTION="\
Gvim is the graphical interface for Vim. This exheres always uses the gtk+-2
interface.

Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text
editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX
systems. Vim is often called a \"programmer's editor\", and so useful for
programming that many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers,
though. Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to
editing configuration files.
