# FIXME: @INC doesn't include 5.8.* dirs
# FIXME: Do this once we get EXJOBS or whatever we end up with:
# The core distribution can now run its regression tests in parallel on
# Unix-like platforms. Instead of running make test, set TEST_JOBS in
# your environment to the number of tests to run in parallel, and run
# make test_harness.
