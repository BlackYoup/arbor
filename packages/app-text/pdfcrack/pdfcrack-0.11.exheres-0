SUMMARY="${PN} is a command line password recovery tool for PDF files"
DESCRIPTION="
${PN} is a GNU/Linux (other POSIX-compatible systems should work too) tool for
recovering passwords and content from PDF files. It is small, command line driven
without external dependencies.
${PN} features both a dictionary and brute-force mode. Thus, it's *not* removing
the password instantly but can take its time. Furthermore, ${PN} does *not*
remove the actual DRM features but just removes the password.
