Subject: [PATCH] Cleanup configure.in using modern autoconf syntax and remove
 unused tests.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Don't use libtool as we're not building any shared library.

Make sure that arguments are properly indented and documented in
./configure --help, avoid abusing conditional expansions.

Check for pthread using AC_SEARCH_LIBS so that it can be easily
extended.

Drop header checks (likely coming from autoscan) given that the code
never tests for HAVE_*_H.

Delete the config.h.in template that is part of the autogenerated files,
and INSTALL that is auto-added by automake (it's not customized).

Define RPCBIND_STATEDIR and RPCUSER directly in Makefile.am as it's done
for the other defines. Drop the config.h support since it's not really
useful at this point. Avoid defining VERSION twice.

 Installation Names

+you can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the
+default for these options is expressed in terms of `${prefix}', so that
+specifying just `--prefix' will affect all of the other directory
+specifications that were not explicitly provided.
+
+   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the
+correct locations to `configure'; however, many packages provide one or
+both of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the
+`make install' command line to change installation locations without
+having to reconfigure or recompile.
+
+   The first method involves providing an override variable for each
+affected directory.  For example, `make install
+prefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all
+directory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of
+`${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during `configure',
+but not in terms of `${prefix}', must each be overridden at install
+time for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of
+makefile variable overrides for each directory variable is required by
+the GNU Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.
+However, some platforms have known limitations with the semantics of
+shared libraries that end up requiring recompilation when using this
+method, particularly noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.
+
+   The second method involves providing the `DESTDIR' variable.  For
+example, `make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend
+`/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of
+`DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and
+does not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,
+it does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even
+when some directory options were not specified in terms of `${prefix}'
+at `configure' time.
+
+Optional Features
+=================
 
    If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
 with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
 option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

+Particular systems
+==================
+
+   On HP-UX, the default C compiler is not ANSI C compatible.  If GNU

+order to use an ANSI C compiler:
+
+     ./configure CC="cc -Ae -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500"
+

+
+   On OSF/1 a.k.a. Tru64, some versions of the default C compiler cannot
