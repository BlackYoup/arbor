SUMMARY="GNU command line editing and history library."
DESCRIPTION="
The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications that allow users to
edit command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available.
The Readline library includes additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command
lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous
commands.
