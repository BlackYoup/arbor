SUMMARY="Bridge support in git for mercurial and bazaar"
DESCRIPTION="
These bridging tools allow for working on Mercurial and Bazaar repositories as
if they were proper git ones, e. g.
git clone hg::http://selenic.com/repo/hello
git clone bzr::lp:gnuhello

Pushing, pulling - everything just works.
