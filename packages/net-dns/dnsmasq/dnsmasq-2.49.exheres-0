SUMMARY="Lightweight DNS forwarder and DHCP server"
DESCRIPTION="
Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server. It is
designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network. It can serve
the names of local machines which are not in the global DNS. The DHCP server
integrates with the DNS server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated addresses
to appear in the DNS with names configured either in each host or in a central
configuration file. Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP/
TFTP/PXE for network booting of diskless machines.
