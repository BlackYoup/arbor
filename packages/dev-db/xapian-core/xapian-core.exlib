Xapian is an Open Source Search Engine Library, released under the GPL. It's
written in C++, with bindings to allow use from Perl, Python, PHP, Java, Tcl,
C# and Ruby (so far!)
Xapian is a highly adaptable toolkit which allows developers to easily add
advanced indexing and search facilities to their own applications. It supports
the Probabilistic Information Retrieval model and also supports a rich set of
boolean query operators.
