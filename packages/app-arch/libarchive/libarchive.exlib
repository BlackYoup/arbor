separate command-line compressors with fixed-signature auto-detection
xz, lzip, and lzma (read and write using liblzma)
tar (read and write, including GNU extensions)
pax (read and write, including GNU and star extensions)
ISO9660 (read and write, including Joliet and Rockridge extensions, with some limitations)
zip (read and write, with some limitations, uses zlib)
mtree (read and write, uses separate libraries for creating and verifying cryptographic hashes)
shar (write only)
ar (read and write, including BSD and GNU/SysV variants)
empty (read only; in particular, note that no other format will accept an empty file)
