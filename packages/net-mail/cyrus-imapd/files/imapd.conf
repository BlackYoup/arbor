# Don't forget to use chattr +S if you are using ext2
# when you change these directories. If you're using ext3, you're safe.
# Choose your filesystem and its mode wisely:
#
# 1. Cyrus needs that the filesystem metadata be kept sane, and that fsync()
#    is honoured.
# 2. Ext3 always does this, in all three modes of operation. Sync writes are
#    never needed.
# 3. Ext2 only does this in sync mode.
