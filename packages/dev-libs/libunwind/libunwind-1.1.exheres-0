SUMMARY="C programming interface to determine the call-chain of a program"
DESCRIPTION="
The primary goal of this project is to define a portable and efficient C
programming interface (API) to determine the call-chain of a program. The API
additionally provides the means to manipulate the preserved (callee-saved) state
of each call-frame and to resume execution at any point in the call-chain
(non-local goto).
