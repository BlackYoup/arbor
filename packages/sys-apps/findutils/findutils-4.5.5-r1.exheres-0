# When bumping, please check *very* carefully, if this has been fixed by checking
# https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?27213 and the testcase described there.
# Note that you will have to comment out --disable-assert in the exlib for the
# test to work. Please re-enable it, though, because upstream's use of assertions
# is... debatable... in any case. (e. g. assertions over "permission denied" don't
# make much sense, IMO.)
